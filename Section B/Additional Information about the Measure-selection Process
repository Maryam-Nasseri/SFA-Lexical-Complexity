Some of the lexical measures were deemed unsuitable for the final selection of the measures in this study 
either because they had not been reported in the linguistics literature to be indicators/predictors of 
advanced academic texts (e.g., from among the count-based indices), or because they gauge lexical complexity 
for non-SLA purposes (e.g., language disorders, child language acquisition, dementia studies, etc). 
A few other omitted measures have a very similar selected measure in the final set of measures 
(i.e., to avoid too many very similar measures in the model). A few measures have also been omitted 
simply because at the time of final analysis of this study, the authors did not find a suitable NLP 
analyser to compute them and/or in a way that matches the preprocessing criteria for the rest of the selected measures. 

Among the measures that were omitted in the final selection of this study are Mendelsohn’s LV 
(Mendelsohn, 1981: LV = V lex × 100 / N), Arnaud’s LV(Arnaud, 1984: LV = V lex / N ), NDW or 
Number of Different Words (Miller, 1996) and NDW-50 (the number of types in the first 50 words 
of a text; two variations of these simple measures have already been included in the final selection), 
SVV1 or Squared VV1 (Chaudron and Parker, 1990: T 2verb / N verb; in the pilot study the CVV1 index 
in Table 1 outperformed the SVV1 index),  ADVV or the Adverb Variation (McClure, 1991: Tadv / Nlex  ) 
and MODV or the Modifier Variation (McClure, 1991: (T adj + T adv) / N lex ) measures were also 
excluded from the analysis as none have been linked to linguistic proficiency in advanced academic texts, 
for example, The adverb variation measure also did not show any between-proficiency differences 
in Paquot’s (2019) analysis of academic research papers.
